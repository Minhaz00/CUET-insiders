# CUET-insiders

MERN Stack project: “CUET INSIDERS”. It’s a mentor finder and social media platform for my university! 🌐


<h2>📌 About the Project:</h2>
For the past few weeks, I've been hard at work designing and developing a dynamic web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This project is not just a website; it's a platform that will help students at my university find their mentors from the industry. It will reduce the gap between university students and industry experts. People can also join exciting events and read the latest news about the different activities at the university.
